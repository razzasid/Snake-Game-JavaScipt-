## About the Project

This Snake Game is a simple, yet fun web-based game where you control a snake to eat food and grow in size. The goal is to score as much as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game speeds up as the score increases, providing a fun challenge for players.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Desktop Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or `WASD` keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Mobile Controls**: Tap the on-screen buttons to move the snake.
- **Pause/Resume**: Press the spacebar or tap anywhere outside the controls to pause and resume the game.

The snake will grow every time it eats food, and the game will end if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
